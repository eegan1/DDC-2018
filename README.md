# Digital Day Camp, 2018 Syllabus
Repository of classes, teachers & resources shared at Eyebeam's youth summer program, [Digital Day Camp]
(https://www.eyebeam.org/events/digital-day-camp-2018-trust/) 'DDC18', a two week long youth art and technology summer intensive.
During DDC18, students worked alongside artist-educators engaging in hands-on workshops focusing on software, hardware, tools, careers in the field and social topics around this year’s theme of **TRUST**. The theme responds to Eyebeam’s current residency cohort and their focus examining relationships between power and technology.

We will challenge youth to apply creative thinking strategies across a range of tools and topics with the goal to develop **critical, empowering and long-lasting relationships with technology** encouraging youth to see their role in its future as agents of change.

### Appropriate Tech: who can speak for whom and how • by [Christopher Clary](https://christopherclary.com/work)

In this workshop students will use their online personas to create art about themselves and their classmates. First we'll discuss appropriation versus privacy and artistic freedom versus social justice — looking at a recent art world controversy. Then we'll learn about zine culture and how it embraces and critques appropriation. Students will create a self-portrait using a thread from their emails, texts, apps, or feeds. Finally, students will portray each other using the same material as a way to see one another differently. Trusting each other with their content.
