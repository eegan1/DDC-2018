# Digital Day Camp, 2018 Syllabus
Repository of classes, teachers & resources shared at Eyebeam's youth summer program, [Digital Day Camp]
(https://www.eyebeam.org/events/digital-day-camp-2018-trust/) 'DDC18', a two week long youth art and technology summer intensive.
During DDC18, students worked alongside artist-educators engaging in hands-on workshops focusing on software, hardware, tools, careers in the field and social topics around this year’s theme of **TRUST**. The theme responds to Eyebeam’s current residency cohort and their focus examining relationships between power and technology.

We will challenge youth to apply creative thinking strategies across a range of tools and topics with the goal to develop **critical, empowering and long-lasting relationships with technology** encouraging youth to see their role in its future as agents of change.

### Appropriate Tech: who can speak for whom and how • by [Christopher Clary](https://christopherclary.com/work)

In this workshop students will use their online personas to create art about themselves and their classmates. First we'll discuss appropriation versus privacy and artistic freedom versus social justice — looking at a recent art world controversy. Then we'll learn about zine culture and how it embraces and critques appropriation. Students will create a self-portrait using a thread from their emails, texts, apps, or feeds. Finally, students will portray each other using the same material as a way to see one another differently. Trusting each other with their content.    

## Day 3, Tuesday July 17th
### [Digital Activism](https://github.com/ariciano/Digital-Activism/blob/master/README.md) • by [Ari J Melenciano](http://www.ariciano.com/about/)

In this course, students will be exploring ways that technology can be used to interpret data and facts into visual or audio interactive experiences.

Students will begin by taking a look at different examples of digital activism and how creatives have merged data and facts with visual and audio experiences.

After spending time exploring different data art creations, students will explore different datasets that we could possibly use in our own creations.We'll then be quickly introduced to p5.js and ways we can quickly build visualizations within it.

Students will spend time building our own data art and then use the last portion of class to share our work.

### [ML5.js: A Friendly Introduction to Machine Learning](https://github.com/yining1023/curriculum/blob/master/EyebeamDDC2018.md) • by [Cristóbal Valenzuela](https://cvalenzuelab.com/) & [Yining Shi](https://1023.io/)

This workshop will allow students to understand the basic principles behind machine learning using live demos. It is also meant to serve as a high level introduction to topics related A.I. A friendly JavaScript web framework for machine learning, called ml5, will be used to show and demonstrate examples and concepts.

The ml5 JavaScript library is a tool for educators to integrate machine learning concepts into introductory coding classes. Together with examples, tutorials, and data sets, the library’s goal is to make machine learning accessible to a broad audience of artists, creative coders, and students (high school and university). The ml5 library provides access to machine learning algorithms and models in the browser with no other external dependencies.
